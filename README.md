### Hi there 👋
- 👷🏻‍♀️ I am Christel, the Founder of Pivotal.

Pivotal is pioneering the infrastructure layer for the Intention Economy, where Bitcoin, AI, and user sovereignty converge to turn ambition into autonomous action. 

Through its Bitcoin Productivity Stack -- a fusion of institutional custody (Ceffu), Bitcoin-secured networks (Babylon protocol), and with PivotalChain activated by rollup-as-a-service leaders (AltLayer) -- 
Pivotal transforms static Bitcoin into programmable fuel for decentralised apps, AI agents, and trustless markets.

With AgentBento (Agents on-chain), EarnTV (intent monetisation), and plusBTC (Bitcoin liquidity), Pivotal empowers users and enterprises to own the upside of their goals, data, and capital. 
Backed by LIF, Babylon Labs, the former head of Binance Research and the founder of WBTC, Pivotal is bridging Bitcoin’s $2T market cap to a future where technology works for you, not on you.
